My research focuses on intelligent and secure wireless communications using advanced signal processing and machine learning approaches. More specifically, I conduct research on the performance modeling and analysis of large-scale beyond 5G/6G multi-band heterogeneous wireless networks. Additionally, I am working towards machine learning enabled intelligent network optimization with applications to massive MIMO and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Finally, I develop secure physical layer key generation protocols based on wireless channels. I have (co)-authored 15+ papers in top-tier IEEE journals and conferences.
