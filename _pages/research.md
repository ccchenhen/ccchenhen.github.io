My research vision is to achieve ubiquitous communication, sensing and intelligence in 6G networks. More specifically, I am working towards machine learning enabled intelligent network optimization with applications to massive MIMO, cell-free massive MIMO, and intelligent metasurfaces. Additionally, I conduct research on the performance modeling and analysis of large-scale beyond 5G/6G multi-band heterogeneous wireless networks.
