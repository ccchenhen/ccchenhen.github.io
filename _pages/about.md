I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Liverpool, UK. I received the B.E. degree from the East China University of Science and Technology, China, in 2018, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Sheffield, UK, in 2022. I was a Marie Curie PhD Fellow. My current research interests include massive MIMO, mmWave/THz networks, wireless security, signal processing, and machine learning.
